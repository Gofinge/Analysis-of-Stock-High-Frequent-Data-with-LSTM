# Analysis-of-Stock-High-Frequent-Data-with-ML

Introduction
====
This project aims at predicting stock price based on high frequency stock data. There is a big difference between
high frequency data and others, thus certain preprocessing methods are necessary in mining useful information.
LSTM is again proved effective in this problem. As a contrast, we also tested some other classical machine learning model such as
XGBoost and random forest.
